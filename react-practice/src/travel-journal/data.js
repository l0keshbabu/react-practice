Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli,who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by the Bahmani Kings,fortified the city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds."
