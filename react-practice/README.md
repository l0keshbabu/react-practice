# React Practice (Scrimba Course)

This repository contains my **React practice work** while learning React through the **Scrimba React course**.

I follow each Scrimba lesson (scrim) and **practice the concepts independently** by building and styling components on my own.  
The goal of this repository is to **strengthen React fundamentals**, understand best practices, and track my learning progress over time.

---

## 📚 What I’m Doing

- Learning React step by step using the Scrimba React course
- Practicing every scrim by implementing it in code
- Refactoring code to follow clean structure and best practices
- Using Git commits to track learning milestones

---

## 🧩 Practice Modules Included

### ✅ Static Page
- Built a static React page using functional components
- Practiced JSX, component structure, assets handling, and CSS styling
- Focused on layout, styling, and clean folder organization

### 🔄 Travel Journal (In Progress)
- Building a travel journal UI inspired by the Scrimba module
- Currently working on layout and styling
- Will refactor into reusable components using props and data mapping

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (Create React App)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Learning Objective

This repository is meant for **learning and practice**, not production use.

As I progress through the course, I will:
- Add new modules
- Improve code structure
- Refactor components
- Apply React concepts like props, state, and list rendering

---

## ▶️ How to Run

npm install
npm start

The app runs locally at:
http://localhost:3000

## Note:
This repository will continue to evolve as I learn more React concepts and build more practice modules.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
